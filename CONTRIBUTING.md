# How to contribute

To contribute to the Phalconator project, it will be necessary to respect various rules of life, here is a non-exhaustive list :

## Commits agreement

All commits must respect a syntax in order to work in good conditions, if this one is not respected then the commit will be refused. The syntax for naming commits is as follows:

`TAG [#123] Your text`

The ticket number shown in square brackets is completely optional, meaning you do not have to specify it. For example:
- OTHER #1 Implements README file
- FEATURE Setting up logs management

etc.

Here is the list of tags accepted by our commits management system:
- FEATURE
- FIXTURE
- RELEASE
- TEST
- OTHER
